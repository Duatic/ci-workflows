"""Flatten a repos.list together with every repos.list its git repositories carry, recursively.

Each git entry's own repos.list is read at the version that entry pins. Two lists naming the same
repository key must agree on its type, url and version, and one url may not appear under two keys;
either is an error that names both lists. The merged list is printed as YAML, ready for `vcs import` or industrial_ci's
UPSTREAM_WORKSPACE.

Usage:  expand_repos.py REPOS_FILE [--exclude-url URL]

--exclude-url drops the repository being built, which a dependency's own list may name in turn.
